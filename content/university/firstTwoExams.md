Well, I just finished my second exam for this semester. It was about computer networks. Acutally a very interesting course. The professor is very good explains everything well and everything was fine. Even the practical part where we had to implement some server-client applications, take benchmarks, measurements and so on. Maybe the practical part was a little bit to much beside of the network implementation. But that's just a minor thing.

The first exam was related to the course "Pathplaning" or "Location Based Services". At the end it was about getting from A to B with the best way and working with graphs. Maybe I link to the repository late...
That course was also nice and interesting but much less intense. And so the practical part was less.

I think I will pass both of them, computer networks maybe not very good but still ok. Lets see...

And actually there was one more grade I already got. Autonomous Systems. But that was a project where we presented our outcome. Maybe I'll write about it in an other post.

But now I take a short break and tomorrow I start with learning for my machine learning exam.

Bye!
