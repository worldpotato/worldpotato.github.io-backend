# Hey! My name is Felix.


I'm a student of Geotelematics and Navigation at the University of Munich University of Applied Science.


That study programm is some kind of special because it merges computer science, electrical engineering and geoinformatics. I'm one of the last students of that programm because the faculty decided to restructured the programm with a little more focus on geoinformatic and less electrical engineering.


Before I studied I did a apprenticeship as "IT-Systemelektroniker" where I learned a bit of Java programming, wiring big fire alarm systems and a lot other IT related stuff. E.g. I configured an AD with some clients, hosted my own homepage and so on. After that I wanted a higher school education and reached the "Fachabitur" after one year at school. To get some experience at "the real world" I began to work at a manufacture of industrial computers, worked in the manufacturing and some month later at the engineering team. 2.5 years of solving problems, helping our sales team and qualifying hardware the decission to study brought me to the University of Applied Science in munich. That's clearly not a straight forward way, but I'm proud of every decission and don't want to miss one step of that way.
