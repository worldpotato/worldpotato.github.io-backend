Whooo! I just finished another semester.
Which means I wrote my last exam for that semester.
It was about machine learning - just the basics.
Actually an interesting course with a crate professor.
But as interesting the topic is as hard it is to prioritise to learn for the exam because one can dive so damn deep in each subtopic.
And of course you can plan more time.
But be honest, you can not learn for 16 hours per day.
At the end I think I found a good way to learn the right things.
Nevertheless I thought the questions would be a little bit more about understanding and application of machine learning and ANN.

The very last thing is to flash Ubuntu 18.04 on a Nvidia TX2 board for student project.
That's a good way to wait until I get my grades on next Friday.
The plan is to start my Bachelor Thesis in the week after.
I'm excited!
