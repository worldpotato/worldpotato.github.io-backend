Hey hey,

I just got my results.
And what should I say?
I improved my average grade or lets say the grades are better than my average grade.
I'm in my last regular semester and that means that these three exams doesn't weight very much in my average grade.
But I'm very proud!

That means I can start wrinting my bachelor theses with a clear conscience and thinking about my options for the master.

Cheers!
